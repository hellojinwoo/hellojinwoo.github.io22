Imagine you're trying to understand the relationship between the number of rooms in a house and its price. You might think that there's a hidden, fixed relationship that determines how these two factors are related, like a universal rule.</p> <p>For example, the relationship might look like: (house price) = \u20ac5,000 x (number of rooms) + \u20ac3,000. In this case, the \u20ac5,000 represents the increase in the house price for each additional room, and the \u20ac3,000 represents the baseline house price when there are no rooms. These values before the varaible, \u20ac5,000 and \u20ac3,000, are called parameters.</p> <p>Parameters help us quantify and understand the underlying patterns in the relationships between variables, like the number of rooms and house prices in our example.
